## Soldering
- **Through-hole Mount Technology**: Electronic components are drilled on the PCB.
- **Surface Mount Technology**: Electronic components are mounted on the top of the PCB.
- **Embedded Mount Technology**: Electronic components are buried inside layers of PCB.
## IC Packaging
- Through-hole
  -	Single in-line package 
  -	Dual in-line package 
- Surface mount
  - Land grid array

## Package dimensions
- C : Clearance between package body and PCB.
- H : Height of package from pin tip to top of package.
- T : Thickness of pin.
- L : Length of package body only.
- LW : Pin width.
- LL : Pin length from package to pin tip.
- P : Pin pitch (distance between conductors to the PCB).
- WB : Width of the package body only.
- WL : Length from pin tip to pin tip on the opposite side.
## Different Types of PCBs
- Single Sided PCB
- Double Sided PCB
- Multi-layer PCB
- Rigid PCB
- Flexible PCB
## PCB Layers

- Prepreg
- Copper Material
- Mechanical Layer
- Overlay / Silkscreen Layers
- Solder Mask Layers
- Solder Paste Layers
- Keep Out Layer
- Split Planes
- Backplane
- Routing Layers
- Carbon Mask
- epoxy resin package
## Surface Finish
- HASL / Lead Free HASL
- Immersion Tin
- OSP / Entek
- Gold – Hard Gold
- Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold (ENIG)
- Electroless Nickel Electroless Palladium Immersion Gold (ENEPIG)
## Paths & Holes.
- Annular Ring
- Blind Via
- Buried Via
- Tented Via
- Via
  - NPTH non-plated through hole
  - Plated-Through Hole
  - Stitching: Connecting two layer with Via.
- Cable
- Plate
- Countersink Hole
- Mounting Hole
- Pad
  - > 1.8 x diameter of the hole.
  - Shapes :: Round : Passive components, Oval : ICs, Rectange: 1st pin of IC.
- Pin or Lead
- Press Fit Hole
- Slot Hole
- Polygon Pour or Copper Pour, Power and Ground Planes.
- Clearance : Space b/w two conductors (components)
- Creepage : distance of the path b/w  two conductors (components)
## Routing
- Interactive Routing
- Differential Pair Routing
- Auto Route
## Files
- Gerber
- NC Drill
## Measurement
- mm
- inches
- thou : 1/1000 inch : mils
- trace to trace space must be >8 mils. 
- trace width must be >10 mils
- lower these number, higher the cost.
- Necking : Change trace space/width small to large or vice-versa
- Copper weight: Ozs, usually 1 oz. higher the no. low resistance.
## Layout Procedure.
- Set your snap grid, visible grid, and default track/pad sizes.
- Throw down all the components onto the board.
- Divide and place your components into functional “building blocks” where possible.
- Identify layout critical tracks on your circuit and route them first.
- Place and route each building block separately, off the board.
- Move completed building blocks into position on your main board.
- Route the remaining signal and power connections between blocks.
- Do a general “tidy up” of the board.
- Do a Design Rule Check.
- Get someone to check it
