## Transmission Lines.
- conductors (Lines)are basically the carriers of electric power from a generating plant to various substations that further delivers the power to the customers.
- Pylon or Transmission Tower. & Utility Pole.
- Electrical grid or Power Grid.
  - Generating stations. > Step Up Transformer(Substation). > High Voltage Transmission Lines > Step down Transformer(Substation) > PowerLines (Distribution Lines) > Houses.
### Corona Discharge.
- The phenomenon of ionisation of surrounding air around the conductor due to which luminous glow with hissing noise is rise is known as the corona effect.
### Factors affecting corona:
- High Voltage Transmission.
- Smooth Conductor Surface.
- Low Air Density, Low Corona Discharge. (High Corona Discharge in Hill areas (Low Air Density).
- Higher the conductor diameter, lower the corona.
- Higher the distance b/w conductors, lower the corona.
- Sharpe edges, high corona.
### Effects from corona:
- High Noise.
- Power loss.
- Interfere radio/TV
### [Detection of corona] (https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-IoT-and-IIoT):
- Airborne Ultrasound Sensor.
