# Interview Prep.
## Transmission Lines.
- conductors (Lines)are basically the carriers of electric power from a generating plant to various substations that further delivers the power to the customers.
- Pylon or Transmission Tower. & Utility Pole.
- Electrical grid or Power Grid.
  - Generating stations. > Step Up Transformer(Substation). > High Voltage Transmission Lines > Step down Transformer(Substation) > PowerLines (Distribution Lines) > Houses.
### Corona Discharge.
- The phenomenon of ionisation of surrounding air around the conductor due to which luminous glow with hissing noise is rise is known as the corona effect.
### Factors affecting corona:
- High Voltage Transmission.
- Smooth Conductor Surface.
- Low Air Density, Low Corona Discharge. (High Corona Discharge in Hill areas (Low Air Density).
- Higher the conductor diameter, lower the corona.
- Higher the distance b/w conductors, lower the corona.
- Sharpe edges, high corona.
### Effects from corona:
- High Noise.
- Power loss.
- Interfere radio/TV
### [Detection of corona] (https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-IoT-and-IIoT):
- Airborne Ultrasound Sensor.   
**Iot**: Smart devices target consumers.   
- home watches, small data etc.
**IIot**: Smart devices target factories.   
- Big data, machine learning, precise sensors.
### Computer Vision.
- Vision of machine.
- Image is filtered for detection.
- Edge Detection.
- Convolution.
- Kernel Convolution.
- Image Detection.
- Image Processing.
- Patches.
- Prewitt operator
- Image detection of Corona Discharge.
- OpenCV - Open Source Computer Vision Library.
- Scikit-image open-source library
### Edge Computing.
- storage and analysis of data nearer to the devices where it’s being gathered, instead of relying on a central location or data center which could be thousands of miles away.
- Edge Devices > Edge Server > Cloud Server.
- Edge Computing : Device <=> Edge Server <=> Cloud Server.
- Cloud Computing : Device <=> Cloud Server.
- Benefits
  - Low Latency.
  - High Bandwith x Low Internet Usage.
  - Releability. <br>
 **Machine learning** uses algorithms to parse data, learn from that data, and make informed decisions based on what it has learned.<br>
 **Deep learning** structures algorithms in layers to create an "artificial neural network” that can learn and make intelligent decisions on its own<br>
