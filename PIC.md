### PIC Dig I/O.
- TRIS A, B, C, D = To enable digital port of PICs. (RA0,1,2 etc., will be set to I/0)
  - TRISA = 0b00000010 = RA1 will be set to Dig I/0.
- Check the datasheet for what TRISx should be used for enabling different RAx or RBx registers.
- ANSEL, ANSELH = To enable analog I/O/
  - ANSEL = 0b00001001 = will enable A8 Pin.
- Check the datasheet if you need to use ANSEL or ANSELH for enabling different Analog Pins.
- PORT A,B,C,D = To write data into the digital pins.
  - PORTA = 0b00000010 = Will write RA1 with 1 bit.
- Some PICs need to be specifed disable Analog or Digital Pins.
- Some PICs have different way of enabling the registers. study before you work with the PIC.
